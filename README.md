<h5>Original App </h5>

I was able to create a simple UI where the user enters the data themselves. The input only accepts correctly spelled city names, or ip address with four decimals, i.e. 1.11.22.33 or, if you would rather the browser do it, just click the auto link.

If you don't want to use the auto button, you can navigate yourself to localhost:3000

To Note:

localhost does not supply an ip so one is hardcoded, however should a real ip be present it is written to (hopefully) take the real ip fist. up until the development of the UI, I worked alone but with the UI and post route using an input field I had help from a friend more advanced than me. The section surrounding the IP and API I completed, but certain sections of the code, where it deals with regex, and using functions inside of routes, these where sections I had help with.
